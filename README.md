# Challenge: Creating a Sorting Algorithm Visualisor Without GUI Experience - The Noob's Journey

## Why?
Wanted to test if I could create an app *Peacefully* using AI (ChatGPT, Bard, Bing) to gain insights about the future.

## How To Install
- Simply install the executable.
- Alternatively, download the repository, compile it yourself, and follow these steps:
    1. Unzip and enter the directory.
    2. Download Python 3.12.0.
    3. After installation, execute the following:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate
    pip uninstall pathlib
    pip install pyinstaller
    python -m pytinstaller gui.py
    ```

## App
### Description:
A straightforward app where you enter five numbers under ten in a text box. Submit it to check its correctness. Then select the algorithm type to execute and begin visualization.

### Gallery
For video: Navigate to the Media Files Folder.

## EXPERIENCE
### Approach
- Used existing Sorting Algorithms from GitHub (initially planned to use those provided by WilliamFiset).
- Attempted a Java-based module for GUI with moving bars displaying sorting algorithms.

### What Happened
- Bard guided the action plan.
    - Suggested libraries that weren't beginner-friendly, pushing me to learn.
    - Chose D3, a JavaScript-based solution, but it created a web app, not a GUI.
    - Had to shift focus for a GUI-based solution. Failed, requiring a new approach.
    - Explored Python solutions, eventually settling for Tkinter after various trials.

### INSIGHTS Earned
- Relying solely on AI for app creation was tough; learning and self-planning are key.
- AI tools complement rather than replace developers; future needs might evolve.
- Better understanding of documentation before AI reliance saves time.
- AI utilization: Apply critical thinking and modify based on documentation understanding.
